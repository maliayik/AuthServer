<h1>AuthServer & MiniApps - JWT Authentication & Authorization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project demonstrates a JWT-based authentication and authorization system using role-based, claim-based, and policy-based authentication. The authentication server (AuthServer.API) issues JWT tokens, while the mini applications (MiniApp1.API, MiniApp2.API, MiniApp3.API) consume these tokens for secure access.


<h2>Project Structure</h2>

AuthServer.API        --> Handles authentication and token issuance
AuthServer.Core       --> Contains policy-based authorization implementation
AuthServer.Data       --> Database and data layer for user authentication
AuthServer.Service    --> Business logic layer for authentication services
MiniApp1.API         --> Example microservice using JWT authentication
MiniApp2.API         --> Example microservice using JWT authentication
MiniApp3.API         --> Example microservice using JWT authentication
SharedLibrary        --> Common utilities and helper functions


Features

- JWT Token Issuance: AuthServer.API generates JWT tokens.

- Role-Based Authorization: Users are granted access based on assigned roles.

- Claim-Based Authorization: Users can be authorized based on specific claims.

- Policy-Based Authorization: Custom authorization policies are applied.

- Token-Based Secure API Communication: The mini applications validate JWT tokens for secure requests.

 <h2>Authentication & Authorization Flow</h2> 

1. User Login â†’ AuthServer.API authenticates user credentials and issues a JWT token.

2. Token Consumption â†’ MiniApp APIs consume the token in requests and validate it.

3. Authorization Handling â†’ Based on roles, claims, and policies, access is granted or denied.

<h2>Setup & Configuration</h2>

1. Clone the Repository

git clone repository-url cd repository-folder

2.  Configure AppSettings

{
  "ConnectionStrings": "Database connection string",
  "TokenOptions": {
    "Issuer": "AuthServer",
    "Audience": "MiniApps",
    "SecretKey": "YourSuperSecretKey"
  },
  "Clients": {
    "Id": "Example",
    "Secret": "secret",
    "Audiences": [ "www.miniapi3.com" ]
  }
}

3. Run the Authentication Server

cd AuthServer.API
dotnet run

<h2>API Endpoints</h2>

api/auth/CreateToken â†’ Generates JWT token.

api/user â†’Creates a new user.

api/stock â†’ Used for claim-based authorization testing.



<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This project provides a modular JWT authentication system with different authorization strategies. The separation of authentication (AuthServer) and service consumers (MiniApps) ensures scalability and security.
